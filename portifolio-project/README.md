# Stock finder


This is a **stock finder** application, investors can use the application to find the stocks which meet their requirement. 
To be specific, People can **filter** stocks depending on  **features** likeï¼š
  
  * category 
  * price range
  * price change 
  * stock exchange
   
  

The application is designed for people who want to *save time* on finding stocks.  

This project is of interest to me because I also buy stocks. The application I used for buying stocks has some fancy functions like technique analysis, price prediction ... , however, the basic filter function is not well designed. Thus, I want to design a application which can help people filter stocks **quickly** and **efficiently**.

## Phase4: Task 2 

* robust option 
* StockCollection Class:  removeStock() method


## Phase4: Task 3
* I think I can refactor some of my methods in my filter panel, list panel and sava and load panel. 
 I found that some methods are too difficult to understand because there are so many codes.  I want to  extract methods 
to capture the behaviour of parts of the methods. As a result, I can improve the cohesion of my code and make my project 
more readable.
